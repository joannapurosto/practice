          <h2 class="work-feature-block-header" id="bangs">Website for Studio Bangs</h2>
          <p>Studio Bangs is a new hair salon that wanted to identifie themselves as a very modern player in the rather crowded industry. It was essential that their web presense convey the feeling so we ended up creating a fresh and easy to use website for their needs.</p>
          <p>Other goal was to start Google AdWords advertising and that has been a real gold mine for the hair salon since they are new player in the field and also because competitors have very weak Google Search Engine Optimisation and Search Engine Marketing in their area. It is rather easy to stand out.</p>

          <h2 class="work-feature-block-header" id="moveko">Website design for RecRight</h2>
          <p>RecRight is my employee and we recreated the whole brand in January 2017. The company launched a new software and changed it's name and the website needed to be recreated by then. I made the drawings for the page in Photoshop and based on that our developers created the webpage. We have already made major improvements to the site since the first launch and we will continue to enhance it.</p>
          <p>This is one project that has sparked my interest in web development since I had to get to know the principles and restrictions of website development when I was designing the page. We are currently using Prismic for content management so any coding isn't required from our marketing department.</p>
